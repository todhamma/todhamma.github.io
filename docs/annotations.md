# Annotations in Archipelago

Archipelago extends [Annotorius](https://github.com/recogito/annotorious) to provide W3C-compliant Web Annotations for Digital Objects. These annotations can be added per image (when multiple), edited for text and shape adjustments, and saved/discarded using the regular Edit mode (bonus track 1: temp storage that persists when you log out and come back in to your session). Archipelago also exposes a full API for WebAnnotations, that keeps track of which Images (referenced in the [Strawberryfield](strawberryfields.md) @ `as:image`) were annotated and creates the W3C valid entries inside your Digital Object's JSON @ `ap:annotationCollection` (bonus track 2: multiple users can annotate the same resource, enabling digital scholarship collaboration opportunities). 

_Important Note: For any image-based Digital Objects you would like to apply annotations to, the Digital Object `type` must be setup to display the image file(s) using the Open SeaDragon viewer. More information about about Managing Display Modes in Archipelago can be found [here](webformsasinput.md#manage-display). Please stay tuned for updates announcing web annotation integration for Mirador 3._
